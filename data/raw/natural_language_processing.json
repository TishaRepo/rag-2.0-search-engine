  "text": "Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, \n                computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions \n                between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers \n                to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.\n\n                Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, \n                natural language understanding, and natural language generation. NLP techniques \n                are used in various applications such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, \n                chatbots, and text summarization.\n\n                Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved NLP capabilities. \n                Transformer models like BERT and GPT have achieved state-of-the-art results \n                on many NLP benchmarks. These models are pre-trained on large text corpora \n                and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks."
