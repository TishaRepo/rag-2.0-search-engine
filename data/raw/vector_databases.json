  "text": "A vector database is a type of database that stores data as high-dimensional \n                vectors, which are mathematical representations of features or attributes. \n                These vectors enable similarity searches, where the database can find items \n                that are most similar to a query vector.\n\n                Vector databases are essential for modern AI applications, particularly those \n                involving natural language processing and recommendation systems. They enable \n                semantic search, where queries return results based on meaning rather than \n                just keyword matching.\n\n                Popular vector databases include Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, and ChromaDB. \n                These systems use approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms to efficiently \n                search through millions or billions of vectors. Common ANN algorithms include \n                HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) and IVF (Inverted File Index).\n\n                The choice of embedding model significantly impacts search quality. Models like \n                OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002, Sentence-BERT, and Cohere's embeddings are \n                commonly used to convert text into vectors for storage and retrieval."
