  "text": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI framework that combines \n                information retrieval with text generation. It enhances large language models (LLMs) \n                by allowing them to reference external knowledge sources before generating responses.\n\n                In a RAG system, when a query is received, relevant documents are first retrieved \n                from a knowledge base using semantic search or keyword matching. These documents \n                are then provided as context to the language model, which generates a response \n                grounded in the retrieved information.\n\n                RAG helps address several limitations of standard LLMs including: hallucinations \n                (generating false information), outdated knowledge, and lack of source attribution. \n                By grounding responses in retrieved documents, RAG systems can provide more accurate \n                and verifiable answers.\n\n                Key components of a RAG system include: a document store, an embedding model for \n                semantic search, a retriever to fetch relevant documents, and a language model \n                for answer generation. Advanced RAG systems may also include re-ranking, \n                query decomposition, and verification modules."
