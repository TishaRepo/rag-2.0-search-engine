  "text": "Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that \n                allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes \n                without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use \n                historical data as input to predict new output values.\n\n                There are four basic approaches to machine learning: supervised learning, \n                unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning. \n                The type of algorithm used depends on the type of data and the desired output.\n\n                Supervised learning uses labeled datasets to train algorithms to classify data \n                or predict outcomes accurately. Unsupervised learning uses machine learning \n                algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. Reinforcement learning \n                is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by \n                performing actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward."
